              I am a software development student at the{' '}
              <strong>Southern Alberta Institute of Technology</strong> and also
              a full stack developer with a passion for creating scalable
              value-induced websites that help people. I am proficient in a
              variety of programming languages and technologies, including{' '}
              <strong>
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Node JS, Express and React.
              </strong>

              I am a highly motivated and results-oriented individual with a
              strong work ethic. I am also a team player and I am always willing
              to learn new things. I am passionate about using my skills to
              create websites that make a positive impact on the world. In my{' '}
              <strong>previous role at TNZ Creations</strong>, I was responsible
              for developing and maintaining the company's website. I worked
              closely with the marketing team to create a website that was both
              visually appealing and user-friendly. I also worked with the
              product team to integrate the website with the company's back-end
              systems. As a result of my work, the company's website saw a
              significant increase in traffic and conversions.

            <p className='leading-[160%]'>
              I am also a strong believer in open source software. I have
              contributed to several open source projects, and I am always
              looking for new ways to give back to the community.
            </p>

              If you are looking for a full stack developer who is passionate
              about creating value-induced websites that help people, I would be
              honored to discuss your project with you.
